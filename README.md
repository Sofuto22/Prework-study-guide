# Study Guide for My Prework!

## Description

My motivation for making my prework study guide site was so I could better remembers the code and short cuts taught to me during prework. I build it so I would have something to look back on when I want to find information about specific points in my work. The problem it solved for me was having to constantly switch between my notebook and screens since now I could just have it up on my second screen to read my notes on the project. During this Prework section I learned a lot of stuff I had no idea about before but I found it all really interesting. It also made me curious about some stuff I was still unsure about but I am looking forward to learning that stuff along my journey in this course. It contains my notes for HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide can be used as a short cut to some helpful coding lines I learned through out the modules. I put down notes on anything I thought would be important for later and to be able to easily find that information. It also cause be useful as a facet for better organizing my hand written notes and giving another chance to absorb the information. Also it shows a running javascrip function in the console that randomizes a topic for me to study in case I am unsure about what I should be focusing on at the time.
